I'm excited to share what I've been working on lately with my team at FluffyLabs. Our main focus has been on building a comprehensive TypeScript implementation of the JAM protocol called **typeberry**, along with a suite of developer tools that make working with JAM more accessible and enjoyable.

## FluffyLabs: Building Blockchain Infrastructure with No Fluff

FluffyLabs is our blockchain development company focused on creating practical, high-quality tools for the decentralized web. Our philosophy is simple: we build stuff that works, without the unnecessary complexity that often plagues blockchain development. As we say on our website, "we build fluffy blockchain stuff, jam is cheap" - reflecting our commitment to making JAM protocol development more approachable.

You can find all our projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/FluffyLabs) and learn more about our work at [fluffylabs.dev](https://fluffylabs.dev).

## Typeberry: Our JAM Implementation

The centerpiece of our current work is **typeberry**, a complete TypeScript implementation of the JAM (Join-Accumulate Machine) protocol. JAM represents the next evolution of Polkadot's architecture, and we're building typeberry to be a developer-friendly, performant implementation that makes it easier for teams to build on this cutting-edge technology.

Currently, typeberry is in stealth mode as we're participating in the decentralized JAM contest, but we're incredibly excited about what we're building. The TypeScript ecosystem provides excellent tooling and developer experience, making it an ideal choice for a JAM implementation that prioritizes accessibility and ease of use.

## Our JAM Developer Toolkit

Beyond typeberry, we've built an entire ecosystem of tools to support JAM development:

### PVM Debugger
A powerful debugging tool for the Polkadot Virtual Machine (PVM) that helps developers understand and troubleshoot their JAM applications. This tool provides detailed insights into PVM execution, making it easier to identify and fix issues during development.

### Gray Paper Reader
An interactive tool designed to help developers read and understand the JAM Gray Paper. The Gray Paper is the technical specification for JAM, and our reader makes this complex document more accessible with enhanced navigation and explanatory features.

### JAM Search
A search engine specifically designed for JAM-related content and documentation. This tool helps developers quickly find the information they need when working with JAM protocols and implementations.

### JAM Codec
A comprehensive codec library for JAM data structures, providing efficient serialization and deserialization capabilities. This is essential infrastructure for any application that needs to interact with JAM networks.

### Trie Visualiser
An educational tool that visualizes Patricia Merkle Tries, which are fundamental data structures used in JAM. This visualization helps developers understand how these complex data structures work and how they're used in the protocol.

### Test Vectors
We maintain comprehensive test vectors for JAM implementations, ensuring compatibility and correctness across different implementations of the protocol.

## The Technology Stack

Our projects primarily use TypeScript, which gives us excellent type safety and developer tooling while maintaining the flexibility needed for blockchain development. We also work with Rust for performance-critical components and Python for various utilities and testing tools.

The choice of TypeScript for our main JAM implementation reflects our commitment to developer experience. The language's strong typing system helps catch errors early, while its extensive ecosystem provides powerful tools for testing, debugging, and deployment.

## Looking Forward

The JAM protocol represents a significant advancement in blockchain technology, and we're proud to be contributing to its ecosystem. Our goal with FluffyLabs is to make this powerful technology accessible to more developers by providing high-quality tools and implementations.

As we continue developing typeberry and expanding our toolkit, we're always looking for ways to improve the developer experience in the JAM ecosystem. Whether you're a seasoned blockchain developer or just getting started with JAM, our tools are designed to help you build better applications more efficiently.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue building the future of decentralized computing with JAM and typeberry. You can follow our progress on [GitHub](https://github.com/FluffyLabs) and connect with us through our website at [fluffylabs.dev](https://fluffylabs.dev).

The future of blockchain development is here, and we're excited to be building it together.
